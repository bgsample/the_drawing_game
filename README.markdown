### the game ###

like the game of telephone, the drawing game involves passing a 
message along from player to player. the difference with the
drawing game is the message alternates from text to drawing.
in other words, the first relayer of the message passes a sentence
along to the next player, who then draws a picture based on that
sentence, and the next player writes a sentence about the picture...
and so on.

### implementation ###

users have a group of friends they can invite to play a game.
a game is passed from player to player for the designated number
of cycles. after the game is completed, it is made public for
all to see, often with hilarious results.

### limitations ###

due to time constraints, i won't be implementing the following
features for this iteration:

- user-based moderation of images posted
- anything more than a purely functional design
